A Malmö-based millennial living with my SO and cats.

Talk to me about

- All things code 🦀
- Tabletop RPGs 🎲
- Folk music and progressive metal 🎵
- Craft beers and whiskey 🍻

I constantly find ways to talk about the programming language Rust, so there's a good chance most of this page will be about just that. I've warned you!
